```
Create a fun, addictive, mobile-friendly Farcaster mini-app game called "Bouncy Banana Barrel".

Game concept (physics-based launcher):
- Player launches a banana projectile from the left side of the screen using touch/swipe: drag finger to set angle and power (like Angry Birds).
- Banana flies with realistic physics: gravity pulls it down, bounces elastically off randomly placed obstacles (floating platforms, walls, bumpers).
- Goal: Land the banana inside a glowing barrel target at the right/bottom of the screen. Perfect center = bonus points!
- If it lands in barrel: WIN with confetti explosion. Miss: retry with "Relaunch".
- Use Matter.js library (via CDN) for pro physics: bouncy collisions, rotation, friction.

Obstacles and levels:
- Level 1: Few simple platforms.
- Auto-progress: After win, add more obstacles (10 levels max, then endless mode).
- Banana peels trail behind for visual fun.

Features:
- Clean, vibrant design: Yellow banana emoji/graphic, wooden barrel, crypto-themed obstacles (e.g., coin bumpers, whale walls). Mobile-first, full-screen canvas.
- Power meter + angle indicator during drag.
- Score: Points = 1000 - (bounces * 100) + (distance bonus). Track high score and streak in localStorage.
- "Next Level" / "Endless Mode" buttons.
- Win screen: Big "SHARE ON FARCASTER" button that auto-generates cast: "🍌 BOUNCED my banana into the barrel in X bounces! Beat my score? Play Bouncy Banana Barrel → [your-miniapp-link] #farcaster #banana #degen"
- Optional wallet connect (Warpcast/WalletConnect): Include @farcaster handle in share.
- Sound effects: Boing on bounce, splash on win (Web Audio API).
- Fast, lightweight, instantly playable in Warpcast.

Generate full standalone HTML + CSS + JS code (include Matter.js CDN), ready to deploy as Base Mini App with farcaster.json verification.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new `.todo` file with the logo description.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A bright yellow banana with a playful expression, slightly tilted, floating above a wooden barrel on a green grassy field. The barrel glows with a golden rim and a soft halo. The background is a clear blue sky with a few fluffy clouds, conveying a fun, vibrant, mobile-friendly game aesthetic.
