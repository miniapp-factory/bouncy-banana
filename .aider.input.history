+Code the following app
+```
+Create a fun, addictive, mobile-friendly Farcaster mini-app game called "Bouncy Banana Barrel".
+
+Game concept (physics-based launcher):
+- Player launches a banana projectile from the left side of the screen using touch/swipe: drag finger to set angle and power (like Angry Birds).
+- Banana flies with realistic physics: gravity pulls it down, bounces elastically off randomly placed obstacles (floating platforms, walls, bumpers).
+- Goal: Land the banana inside a glowing barrel target at the right/bottom of the screen. Perfect center = bonus points!
+- If it lands in barrel: WIN with confetti explosion. Miss: retry with "Relaunch".
+- Use Matter.js library (via CDN) for pro physics: bouncy collisions, rotation, friction.
+
+Obstacles and levels:
+- Level 1: Few simple platforms.
+- Auto-progress: After win, add more obstacles (10 levels max, then endless mode).
+- Banana peels trail behind for visual fun.
+
+Features:
+- Clean, vibrant design: Yellow banana emoji/graphic, wooden barrel, crypto-themed obstacles (e.g., coin bumpers, whale walls). Mobile-first, full-screen canvas.
+- Power meter + angle indicator during drag.
+- Score: Points = 1000 - (bounces * 100) + (distance bonus). Track high score and streak in localStorage.
+- "Next Level" / "Endless Mode" buttons.
+- Win screen: Big "SHARE ON FARCASTER" button that auto-generates cast: "🍌 BOUNCED my banana into the barrel in X bounces! Beat my score? Play Bouncy Banana Barrel → [your-miniapp-link] #farcaster #banana #degen"
+- Optional wallet connect (Warpcast/WalletConnect): Include @farcaster handle in share.
+- Sound effects: Boing on bounce, splash on win (Web Audio API).
+- Fast, lightweight, instantly playable in Warpcast.
+
+Generate full standalone HTML + CSS + JS code (include Matter.js CDN), ready to deploy as Base Mini App with farcaster.json verification.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.

+Create a super fun, addictive, mobile-first Farcaster mini-app game called **"Bouncy Banana Barrel"**.
+
+Core gameplay (Angry Birds-style physics launcher):
+- The player drags and releases from the left side of the screen to launch a yellow banana projectile.
+- Use Matter.js (loaded from CDN) for realistic bouncy physics: gravity, elastic collisions, rotation, and a little friction.
+- The banana leaves a funny trail of tiny banana peels behind it.
+- Goal: land the banana inside a glowing wooden barrel placed somewhere on the right/bottom of the screen.
+- Perfect center hit = extra bonus points!
+- On win → huge confetti explosion + victory screen.
+- On miss → simple "Relaunch" button.
+
+Main Menu (first screen the player sees):
+A beautiful full-screen start menu with three big buttons:
+1. START → begins at the highest unlocked level (or Level 1 if nothing unlocked)
+2. SELECT LEVEL → shows only the levels the player has already completed (Level 1 to max 10 + Endless Mode if unlocked)
+3. EXIT → closes the mini-app (window.close() or friendly message)
+
+Levels & Progression:
+- 10 hand-crafted levels with increasing difficulty (more platforms, moving bumpers, crypto-themed obstacles like golden coins, whale walls, etc.).
+- After beating Level 10 → unlock Endless Mode (randomly generated obstacles forever).
+- Progress, high scores, and current streak saved in localStorage.
+
+Visual & Audio:
+- Vibrant, colorful, cartoonish design (sky background, wooden barrel, big yellow banana).
+- Power + angle indicator while dragging.
+- Score formula: 1000 − (bounces × 100) + distance bonus.
+- Fun sound effects: "boing" on every bounce, triumphant "splash" when landing in the barrel (use Web Audio API or simple <audio> tags).
+- Confetti on win (use canvas-confetti).
+
+Win / Share Screen:
+After winning a level show:
+- Your score and bounces
+- "Next Level" button (or "Play Endless" when appropriate)
+- Huge "SHARE ON FARCASTER" button that auto-generates a perfect cast:
+  "Just bounced my banana into the barrel in only X bounces! 🍌
+  Score: XXXX 🔥 Beat me if you can!
+  Play Bouncy Banana Barrel → [your-miniapp-url]
+  #BouncyBanana #farcaster #degen"
+- Optional: if wallet is connected via Warpcast/WalletConnect, automatically add the player’s @farcaster handle.
+
+Technical requirements:
+- Single standalone HTML file (HTML + CSS + JS inline).
+- Include Matter.js via CDN.
+- Fully mobile-friendly, touch-only controls, no mouse needed.
+- Works instantly inside Warpcast (Base Mini App).
+- Include the necessary farcaster.json metadata in a comment at the top so it can be deployed as a verified Farcaster mini-app.
+- Fast loading, lightweight, no external dependencies except Matter.js CDN and optional canvas-confetti.
+
+Make everything smooth, juicy, and ridiculously fun! 🍌✨
