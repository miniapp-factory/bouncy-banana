+Code the following app
+```
+Create a fun, addictive, mobile-friendly Farcaster mini-app game called "Bouncy Banana Barrel".
+
+Game concept (physics-based launcher):
+- Player launches a banana projectile from the left side of the screen using touch/swipe: drag finger to set angle and power (like Angry Birds).
+- Banana flies with realistic physics: gravity pulls it down, bounces elastically off randomly placed obstacles (floating platforms, walls, bumpers).
+- Goal: Land the banana inside a glowing barrel target at the right/bottom of the screen. Perfect center = bonus points!
+- If it lands in barrel: WIN with confetti explosion. Miss: retry with "Relaunch".
+- Use Matter.js library (via CDN) for pro physics: bouncy collisions, rotation, friction.
+
+Obstacles and levels:
+- Level 1: Few simple platforms.
+- Auto-progress: After win, add more obstacles (10 levels max, then endless mode).
+- Banana peels trail behind for visual fun.
+
+Features:
+- Clean, vibrant design: Yellow banana emoji/graphic, wooden barrel, crypto-themed obstacles (e.g., coin bumpers, whale walls). Mobile-first, full-screen canvas.
+- Power meter + angle indicator during drag.
+- Score: Points = 1000 - (bounces * 100) + (distance bonus). Track high score and streak in localStorage.
+- "Next Level" / "Endless Mode" buttons.
+- Win screen: Big "SHARE ON FARCASTER" button that auto-generates cast: "🍌 BOUNCED my banana into the barrel in X bounces! Beat my score? Play Bouncy Banana Barrel → [your-miniapp-link] #farcaster #banana #degen"
+- Optional wallet connect (Warpcast/WalletConnect): Include @farcaster handle in share.
+- Sound effects: Boing on bounce, splash on win (Web Audio API).
+- Fast, lightweight, instantly playable in Warpcast.
+
+Generate full standalone HTML + CSS + JS code (include Matter.js CDN), ready to deploy as Base Mini App with farcaster.json verification.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
